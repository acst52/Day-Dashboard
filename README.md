# Day-Dashboard - Group Project 1!

Hi and welcome to our README for the first group project! This proposal outlines a day dashboard that users can visit to get an overview of their time, whether it be their day, week or month. Users can write in checklists of tasks or items to buy, check them off, gain some motivation from a random quote, and interact with cute elements including a random joke generator and love calculator.

### Motivation
The motivation for this application is to provide users a place to write down their to-do lists that is aesthetic and satisfying to promote motivation and productivity.


## User Story

```md
AS a person who wants to plan their day 
I WANT to bring my task list with me 
SO THAT I can proceed with ease & reward myself regularly
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN I am using the day-dashboard application to plan my to-do lists,
WHEN I open the day-dashboard,
THEN I can read a motivational quote that changes every day
WHEN I am ready to plan out my tasks,
THEN the to-do list/planner is ready for my input
WHEN I close my browser, my to-do list is stored locally
THEN I can return to the page and update my tasks throughout the day
WHEN I finish a task
THEN I can check it off in a satisfying way
WHEN I am idle waiting for an appointment, on hold or simply bored
THEN I can use the love calculator, joke and activity generating APIs
```
